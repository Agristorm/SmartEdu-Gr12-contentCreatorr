**Grade 12 Life Sciences Homework: Mitosis**

**Instructions:** Answer all questions in your own handwriting.  This homework covers the content of Chapter [Insert Chapter Number Here] from your textbook.

**Section 1: Understanding Mitosis (Knowledge & Understanding)**

1.  Define mitosis.  Explain its significance in multicellular organisms, providing at least two specific examples of processes reliant on mitosis in humans (e.g., growth, repair). (5 marks)

2.  Briefly describe the four phases of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase), highlighting the key events that occur in each.  Use labelled diagrams to illustrate your answer.  You may choose to focus on one phase in more detail. (10 marks)

**Section 2: Applying your Knowledge (Application & Analysis)**

3.  A skin cell in your body undergoes mitosis.  Describe what would happen if the chromosomes did not separate correctly during anaphase. What are the potential consequences of this error? (5 marks)

4.  Cancer is characterised by uncontrolled cell division.  Explain how errors in the control mechanisms of mitosis contribute to the development of cancerous tumours.  Consider the role of checkpoints in your explanation.  (5 marks)

**Section 3: Critical Thinking (Analysis & Synthesis)**

5.  Compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis.  Focus on the number of daughter cells produced, the genetic makeup of the daughter cells, and the purpose of each process.  Present your answer in a table format. (5 marks)


**Examples to Consider (for Section 2):**

*   For Question 3: Think about the implications of aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number) on cell function and potential health risks.
*   For Question 4:  Research the role of proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes in regulating the cell cycle and consider how mutations in these genes can lead to cancer.


**Assessment Criteria:**  Marks will be awarded based on accuracy, completeness of answers, clarity of explanations, correct use of scientific terminology, and appropriate use of diagrams where required.  Remember to use your textbook and class notes to help you answer these questions.

**Submission:** This homework is due on [Insert Due Date Here].  Please ensure your name and class are clearly written on your work.
