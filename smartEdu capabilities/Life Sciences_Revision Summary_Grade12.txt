**Grade 12 Life Sciences Revision Summary: Mitosis**

**1. Introduction:**

Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth.  It's crucial for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in organisms.  Understanding the phases is key.

**2. Phases of Mitosis:**

Remember the acronym PMAT to help you remember the stages:

* **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense and become visible.  The nuclear membrane breaks down, and spindle fibres (microtubules) begin to form.  Think of it like packing your suitcase before a journey – organising your chromosomes.

* **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate (the equator of the cell).  Spindle fibres attach to the centromeres of each chromosome.  Imagine them lining up neatly for a parade.

* **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, pulled by the spindle fibres.  Think of it as the parade dispersing – each chromosome going its separate way.

* **Telophase:** Chromosomes reach the poles, decondense, and become invisible again.  The nuclear membrane reforms around each set of chromosomes.  The cell starts to divide (cytokinesis).  This is like unpacking your suitcase at your destination.

**3. Cytokinesis:**

This is the final stage, where the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.  In plant cells, a cell plate forms; in animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms.

**4. Significance of Mitosis:**

* **Growth:**  Allows multicellular organisms to grow from a single fertilised egg.
* **Repair:** Replaces damaged or worn-out cells (e.g., skin cells).
* **Asexual Reproduction:**  Produces genetically identical offspring in organisms like bacteria and some plants.

**5. Assessment Questions:**

1.  Draw and label a diagram of a cell in metaphase.
2.  What is the significance of spindle fibres in mitosis?
3.  Explain the difference between cytokinesis in plant and animal cells.
4.  Give two examples of organisms that reproduce asexually using mitosis.
5.  Why is it important that the daughter cells produced by mitosis are genetically identical to the parent cell?


**6.  Further Revision:**

Consult your textbook and class notes for more detailed information and diagrams. Practice drawing the phases of mitosis and labelling the key structures.  Focus on understanding the processes and significance of each phase. Remember to relate your learning to practical examples in your environment.  Good luck with your exams!
