**Life Sciences Grade 12: Mitosis Study Guide**

**Topic:** Mitosis – Cell Division for Growth and Repair

This study guide covers the process of mitosis, its significance, and its application within the CAPS curriculum.

**1. Understanding Mitosis:**

Mitosis is a type of cell division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell.  This is crucial for growth, repair of damaged tissues, and asexual reproduction in some organisms.  Think of it as creating perfect copies – each daughter cell receives an exact duplicate of the parent cell's chromosomes.

**2. Stages of Mitosis:**

Mitosis is a continuous process, but for understanding, we divide it into four main phases:

* **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense and become visible, the nuclear membrane breaks down, and spindle fibres form.  Imagine tightly coiling a rope (the DNA).
* **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the equator (centre) of the cell, attached to the spindle fibres. Think of them lining up for a race.
* **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids (identical copies) separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.  Imagine the rope splitting into two halves being pulled apart.
* **Telophase:** Chromosomes decondense, the nuclear membrane reforms around each set of chromosomes, and the cell begins to divide (cytokinesis).  The cell is essentially rebuilding itself, creating two new nuclei.

**3. Cytokinesis:**

This is the final stage where the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two separate daughter cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms, while in animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms.

**4. Significance of Mitosis:**

Mitosis is essential for:

* **Growth:**  From a single fertilised egg, mitosis enables the development of a multicellular organism.
* **Repair:**  Damaged tissues are replaced through the mitotic division of existing cells.  For example, skin healing after a cut.
* **Asexual Reproduction:**  Organisms like amoeba reproduce asexually through mitosis.

**5. Assessment Questions:**

1.  Draw and label a diagram showing the stages of mitosis.
2.  Explain the significance of mitosis in growth and repair.
3.  What is the difference between mitosis and cytokinesis?
4.  Give an example of an organism that reproduces asexually through mitosis.
5.  What is the significance of spindle fibres in mitosis?
